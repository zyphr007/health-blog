          "Think differently about stigma. Mental health stigma can prevent people from seeking help. Don’t let the fear of others’ thoughts keep you from doing what is best for you. Remember that stigma arises from misinformation and a lack of understanding. Just because some people are ignorant about mental health doesn’t mean that you should suffer because of it. Reaching out for help can improve your life, and nothing you do or do not do will affect the lives of people who stigmatize."
