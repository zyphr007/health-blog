          " Learning to say no after trauma can feel like stepping on someone's toes without stopping to apologize. In other words, it can feel harsh, cruel, rude, and downright awful to set a boundary or put your needs first. Through my experience enduring childhood sexual assault, I learned that my body was not my own. This idea made saying no after trauma very difficult."

          "Learning to say no after enduring a trauma, especially abuse of any sort, is a crucial part of healing and protecting yourself. (Re)victimization, or the recurrence of the same trauma on a particular individual, is a common outcome of childhood abuse.1 For example, because I was sexually assaulted at the age of four, I grew up with low self-esteem and struggled to stand up for myself in similar instances. Oftentimes, when put into a high-stress situation, I dissociate. Instead of thinking clearly and rationally, I get this fuzzy feeling in my brain and go into what feels like a zombie-like trance. Sufferers of assault may be able to learn to address these wounds and say no in such situations with therapy."

        parah1List2={
          "I've been on my healing journey for most of my life, but it wasn't until four years ago that I fully admitted to and confronted my assault head-on. Since then, I've been working on setting boundaries in various aspects of my life, from my career to my relationships. Each time I listen to myself and prioritize my own needs, I feel both guilt and pride. I'm choosing to focus on the latter."

          "Even though it's uncomfortable, learning to say no can be empowering. Additionally, it can help you find the right support system. If someone doesn't respect your boundaries, you quickly discover they aren't for you."

          "  Experiencing trauma can profoundly impact every aspect of our lives, including our ability to set and maintain healthy boundaries. Whether it's due to past abuse, assault, or other traumatic experiences, learning to say no after trauma can be a daunting but essential aspect of healing and reclaiming agency over our lives. In this blog, we'll explore the challenges survivors face in setting boundaries post-trauma and offer strategies for learning to say no with confidence and self-compassion."

          " Trauma can disrupt our sense of safety, trust, and autonomy, making it difficult to establish and enforce boundaries in relationships and situations. Survivors may struggle with feelings of guilt, shame, and fear when asserting their needs or saying no to others, fearing rejection, abandonment, or retaliation. Additionally, trauma can distort perceptions of boundaries, leading to confusion, self-doubt, and a diminished sense of self-worth."
